* Talked about setting up building a website by vibe coding
* Modern websites aren't built with vanilla HTML, JavaScript, or CSS but with a web framework
* A web framework is just a whole bunch of code someone else wrote that you can use to make your code quicker
* Quicker not as in run faster, but less lines of code
* Use frameworks for backend and frontend
* Can also use frameworks for databases
